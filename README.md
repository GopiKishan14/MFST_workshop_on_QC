# Microsoft Workshop on Quantum Computing

This repository consists of implementation (in Q#) of several quantum algorithms discussed in the workshop.

## About

## Installation Guideline
Install the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit (QDK). Complete detail at Microsoft [Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/).
The QDK is available for multiple development environments.
* Install Q# for C#
* Install Q# for Python
* Install Q# for Jupyter Notebooks

This repository uses Q# for C# in VS Code for implementation of Quantum Algorithms.

## Dir structure
* Hello_World
    - A Q# + python based hello world program.

```
 A Q# + c# based implementations.
 It contains all the code and simulator of the Q. Algorithms.
```
* Qsharp 
    * Driver.cs
      - This is the simulator for Qubit manipulation.
    * Program.qs
